# New-York-Property-Sales
Background Information:

The dataset of NYC Property Sales contains information about real estate transactions in New York City for the financial year 2016-2017. Government agencies, such as the NYC Department of Finance or similar organizations, typically collect and maintain this dataset. It includes a wide range of information about property sales, such as property addresses, sale prices, sale dates, property types, and more. This dataset contains the location, address, type, sale price, and sale date of building units sold. 

NYC Department of Finance: This is a government agency responsible for collecting property-related taxes and maintaining property records in New York City. They collect data on property sales as part of their tax assessment and collection process.
Real Estate Industry: The real estate industry in New York City is a critical part of the economy. It includes real estate developers, brokers, property management companies, and investors. Access to accurate and comprehensive property sales data is crucial for various stakeholders in this industry to make informed decisions.

The main objective of the project is to present a Sale Price column and time-based analysis using Sale Dates, and how property prices have evolved over time. Additionally, by examining the Borough and Neighborhood columns, I can assess the spatial distribution of real estate activity, identifying which areas are experiencing heightened demand.
BUILDING CLASS CATEGORY and BUILDING CLASS AT PRESENT/TIME OF SALE columns allow for categorization and analysis of different property types. We can identify which types of properties are in high demand or have higher sales prices. Columns like RESIDENTIAL UNITS, COMMERCIAL UNITS, LAND SQUARE FEET, GROSS SQUARE FEET, and YEAR BUILT offer insights into property characteristics. We can analyze the size, type (residential or commercial), and age of properties sold.
